# ChatOpenAI

You can use OpenAI's chat models as follows:

import OpenAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAI}</CodeBlock>

If you're part of an organization, you can set `process.env.OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` with your OpenAI organization id, or pass it in as `organization` when
initializing the model.
